**Student Name:** Anudeep Reddy Reddygari  
**Student ID:** 1230084

## Project Description

The Veterinary Clinic Management System is a Spring Boot–based RESTful application designed to manage daily operations of a veterinary clinic. The system handles owners, pets, medical records, vets, appointments, and treatments using a structured backend architecture.

The project demonstrates proper use of Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, and REST APIs with real-world entity relationships such as One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many. CRUD operations are implemented for all major entities, and relationships are managed safely through the service layer to avoid common JPA issues.

This project focuses on clean code structure, correct relationship handling, and practical API design suitable for academic evaluation and real-world learning.
